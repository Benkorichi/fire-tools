* We identified important parameters for aerosol deposition in various flow conditions
* Predicted aerosol deposition quantities are compared to experimentally measured data
* We considered gravitational settling, thermophoresis, and turbulent deposition
* Deposition mechanisms were implemented in a computational fluid dynamics model
