THIS SECTION PRESENTLY BEING COMPLETED BY MPC

The subject of model uncertainty and input parameter uncertainty and sensitivity has been covered extensively in the literature \cite{Spiegel, Vose, Kumamoto, Haimes}.  There are numerous studies specific to fire modelling.  

Hostikka and Rahkonen \cite{Hostikka:2003a} used Monte Carlo simulation and CFAST to evaluate model sensitivity to numerous  input parameters such as fire power and growth rate, compartment geometry, and ventilation. This work estimated probabilities in terms of time to failure of electric cables in a tunnel fire, and hot gas layer development  in a compartment due to an electrical cabinet fire. 

A technique for calculating the uncertainty in model outputs resulting  from input parameter uncertainty is provided in Volume 2 of NUREG-1824. This method involves quantifying the functional dependence of the input parameters, based on the governing mathematical equations or simple algebraic correlations. This method is also presented in the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) Technical Reference Guide Volume 3: Validation.

A method for calculating model uncertainty is derived in \cite{McGrattan2011a} and summarized in the FDS Technical Reference Guide. This method involves comparisons of model predictions with experimental measurements. The paper derives formulae to calculate  a bias factor and a relative standard deviation for a given model.  The results of the application of this technique for a number of fire models are presented in NUREG-1824.

%Outline
%
%Monte Carlo analyses, sensitivity analyses and uncertainty analyses have been done a lot in modelling. In fire modelling, some of the papers that have done this include Hostika (four or five papers).
% 
% Hostikka et al : say what they addressed. sensitivity? model uncertainty and bias? combined?
% what model did they use, what did they address. what did they vary,  two or three sentences for each.
% 
% Four or five references, including Simo's and a good sensitivity study. 1934, FDS guide
%  one or two sentences for each
% 
% ours is going to be a worked example but there are many much other work,
